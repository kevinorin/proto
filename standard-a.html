            <p class="first-prgph mb-27"><firstletter>B</firstletter>y and large, both investors and fund professionals rely heavily on past performance in their fund selection
    process. The problem is that past performance is of little use in identifying funds or managers who will deliver
    superior future performance relative to their peer group.</p>
            
            <p>Numerous studies have failed to unearth a significant positive correlation between past relative performance and
    future relative performance. The only correlation found has been the consistency of managers with very bad returns
    to continue to post bad returns in the future. These results are true even if looking at performance of managers within
    their respective peer groups. So why do investors insist on basing important decisions on data that does not increase
    their chances for success? There are several reasons:</p>
            <ul class="listing_info">
                <li>Many investors either donʼt realize that track records lack predictive value or simply donʼt want to believe it.</li>
                <li>The industry, including fund companies, mutual fund rating agencies (with their ranking systems based on past
    performance), the financial media and many advisors all tout past performance, and in doing so support that
    fantasy that it can be used as the basis for making successful investment decisions.</li>
                <li>Investors donʼt know what else to look for, and may also lack the resources and time to dig beyond the numbers.
    Historical performance numbers are easy to get and to understand. On the other hand, research that goes beyond
    past performance numbers is a labor-intensive process that is time consuming, demands experience and
    knowledge of what to look for, and requires access to fund management firms that most investors and advisors
    donʼt have.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of this begs the question: Why arenʼt track records predictive? First, some managers with strong records have
    simply been lucky. And eventually, luck runs out. But beyond that, shouldnʼt we expect some subset of the best
    performing managers to be among the most skilled and therefore, as a group, shouldnʼt funds with better historical
    records continue to outperform? Our experience evaluating active managers leaves us less than surprised by the
    inability of winners to consistently repeat. Our research indicates that even skilled managerʼs past success oIen sows
    the seeds of their future underperformance. There are a variety of reasons that we have identified as to why
    maintaining an investment edge is difficult:</p>
            <ul class="listing_info">
                <li><strong>Success results in asset growth.</strong> Asset growth may lead to declining flexibility, especially for smaller cap
    managers, and result in a smaller universe of investable stocks. Even larger-cap oriented managers occasionally
    buy stocks of middle and smaller sized companies if they are extremely compelling. Also, as assets under
    management grow, a fund manager may be forced to own more stocks in the portfolio and this may lead to a
    dilution of their best ideas because they are buying names in which they have less conviction in order to fill out the
    portfolio. Or, as assets grow the manager may have to own a larger percentage of a companyʼs outstanding shares,
    which increases the liquidity and market impact risk if they need to sell the position quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Success oIen leads to “stardom” and the temptation to leverage the marketability of the portfolio
    management team by launching other products.</strong> This may force the management team to manage other types
    of portfolios thus reducing their focus on the original fund. And focus is critically important to winning the
    investment game.</li>
                <li><strong>Team turnover.</strong> Success and stardom may lead the manager or key members of the team to move on to other
    firms / hedge funds, or start their own. If key players leave a fund, the fundsʼ prior track record is basically
    worthless when evaluating the fund going forward.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="fancy_info">
                Value added comes from identifying why a fund performed well in
    the past, determining if the portfolio management team has an
    identifiable edge (i.e., do we think the past performance was due to
    luck or skill) and assessing whether the edge, if one exists, is
    sustainable.
            </div>
            <p class="mb-45">The fact that track records are not useful in predicting future relative performance is the basis on which index fund
    proponents conclude that low cost index funds are the better choice. But we disagree with the underlying premise.
    The fact that track records are not predictive is not tantamount to concluding that superior future performers canʼt be
    identified in advance. It simply means that the track record does not provide sufficient information to do so. (Does
    anyone really expect that investment success should be as simple as projecting the past into the future?) Our
    approach to fund research recognizes that past performance is useful only as a tool for screening funds to identify
    those that may be worthy of further research. Value added comes from identifying why a fund performed well in the</p>
            
            <h3>The Litman Gregory Equity Manager Research Process</h3>
            
            <h5>Step One: Performance Screens.</h5>
            <p>Our approach to researching equity funds and their stock pickers recognizes that past performance is useful only as a
    tool for identifying managers that may be worthy of further in-depth qualitative research. So performance screens
    and quantitative analysis are a starting point in our research process. We consider funds and managers that have
    outperformed their peer group and benchmarks over a reasonably long period of time. Generally we require a
    minimum of five years of performance. However, occasionally we will consider funds with a shorter record. We are
    also willing to take into account a manager's institutional separate account record prior to the mutual fund's
    inception if we believe it is representative of how the existing fund would have performed over the same time period.
    We have created our own proprietary database of manager returns that enables us to incorporate separate account
    and mutual fund track records. In addition to absolute performance we take into account:</p>
            <p>Performance consistency, volatility and downside risk relative to the fund's peer group and benchmarks over a wide
    variety of time periods (which we can adjust in our database).</p>
            <p>Special factors that <strong><a href="standard-a.html">impacted performance</a></strong> that may not be repeatable.</p>
            <p>The level of assets on which the record was based (performance generated with a tiny asset base can be a red flag).</p>
            <p class="mb-45">Expenses. We have expense thresholds of 1.2% for larger-cap funds and 1.5% for international and smaller-cap funds.
    However, we will make an exception for a new fund with a tiny asset base if the expense ratio will fall below our
    threshold as assets increase.</p>
            <h5>Step Two: Due Diligence Questionnaire and Document Review.</h5>
            <p class="mb-45">If a fund/manager passes our performance screens and looks promising on a quantitative basis, the next step is for
    the fund management firm to complete our detailed due diligence questionnaire consisting of about 50 questions.
    The purpose of the questionnaire is to start to build our understanding of their investment approach and
    management practices. Our questions delve into the firmʼs investment philosophy and process, portfolio
    management and risk control policies, team members and roles, their compensation practices and incentives, and
    growth plans. We also read all of the fundʼs shareholder reports and manager commentaries going back a number of
    years, as well as any media articles and interviews that may give us additional insights into their thinking and
    decision-making process.</p>
            <h5>Step Three: Initial Portfolio Manager Interview.</h5>
            <p>AIer reviewing the responses to our questionnaire we always have a number of additional and more detailed followup
    questions, so we set up a phone interview (unless the firm is in the San Francisco Bay Area) with the portfolio
    manager(s). This is an important part of the process in which we begin to qualitatively assess the managerʼs discipline
    and skill. We ask for many specific examples as we attempt to verify that the managerʼs actual practices are in line
    with how the investment process is articulated in the questionnaire and other documents. We also want to
    understand the reasoning behind the managerʼs investment philosophy and process. We also usually set up phone
    calls with numerous members of the analyst team to start to assess their quality and contribution to the process.</p>
            <p>OIen aIer this initial phone contact we eliminate the manager from further consideration, despite their strong
    historical performance, due to major qualitative red flags. For example, we may find the manager to be an empire
    builder, overconfident of their abilities, lacking concern about excessive asset growth or spreading themselves too
    thin in regards to marketing activities or the number of products they manage. Or we may not be able to get
    comfortable with the managerʼs philosophy or research process, and be unable to see clearly how their past success
    can be repeated and sustained.</p>
            <p class="mb-45">However, if aIer the initial interviews we are sufficiently impressed with the managerʼs investment process, discipline
    in executing that process, and plans for managing growth, we schedule a visit to their offices, or invite them to visit
    us.</p>
            <h5>Step Four: The Site Visit.</h5>
            <p>Our objectives of the site visit are to spend time face-to-face with the manager(s) and also visit with the analyst team and other key investment team members, e.g., traders. We are trying to assess the following (and there is overlap with the initial phone calls):</p>
            <p>Determine if there is consistency between the way the manager describes their investment process and the stocks they actually own. We want to know if the way in which each stock was researched and the justification for the buy decision is in line with the investment philosophy, so we grill the manager about stocks in the portfolio. We also assess their sell discipline by discussing stocks that have been sold and the reasons why. If we find inconsistencies</p>

                    <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investorʼs shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance of the funds may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. To obtain standardized performance, please click HERE</p>
                    <p><i>Litman Gregory Masters Fundsʼ</i> investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company, and it may be obtained by clicking here <i>or a free hard copy is available</i> by calling 1-800-960-0188. Read it carefully before investing.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Each of the funds may invest in foreign securities. Investing in foreign securities exposes investors to economic, political, and market risks and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Each of the funds may invest in the securities of small companies. Smallcompany investing subjects investors to additional risks, including security price volatility and less liquidity than investing in larger companies.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">The International Fund will invest in emerging markets. Investments in emerging market countries involve additional risks such as government dependence on a few industries or resources, government-imposed taxes on foreign investment or limits on the removal of capital from a country, unstable government, and volatile markets.</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Investments in debt securities typically decrease when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investor should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity, and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. Investments in lower-rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management, and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. The Alternative Strategies Fund may make short sales of securities, which involves the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Investment in absolute return strategies are not intended to outperform stocks and bonds during strong market rallies.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Merger arbitrage investments risk loss if a proposed reorganization in which the fund invests is renegotiated or terminated.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Leverage may cause the effect of an increase or decrease in the value of the portfolio securities to be magnified and the fund to be more volatile than if leverage was not used.</p>
